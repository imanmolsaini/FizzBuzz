# FizzBuzz with a Twist

Welcome to my **FizzBuzz with a Twist** project! This is a JavaScript implementation of the classic FizzBuzz game, enhanced with a fun additional rule.

---

## Overview

FizzBuzz is a popular programming exercise that teaches basic logic, loops, and conditionals. In this project:

- Numbers divisible by **3** output: `Fizz`
- Numbers divisible by **7** output: `Buzz`
- Numbers divisible by **both 3 and 7** output: `FizzBuzz`
- Numbers **containing the digit "3"** but not divisible by 3 or 7 output: `Almost Fizz`
- All other numbers output the number itself

## Example

For input `num = 20`, the output will be:
